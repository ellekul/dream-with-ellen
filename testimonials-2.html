It was truly a joy to step into the classroom (or Zoom meeting) knowing that it would be a fun and welcoming environment.</p><p>You didn’t just teach me—you inspired me to become smarter, work harder, and be dedicated to what I do. I’m grateful for all the time you put into your lessons and the effort you made to make sure everyone could have the best experience.</p><p>Instead of telling me what to see, you showed me where to look. You never revealed the answer, but questioned us, encouraging us to think harder. Even though it was on a Sunday, your classes were still the highlight of my day.</p><p>You always had your door open for people who needed an extra push. You didn’t just stuff us with knowledge, or tell us to memorize formulas. You actually explained why things work, and made us go the extra mile. That was one of the best lessons I’ve ever had. Because of you, I’ve learned that the question <em>“why?”</em> is so much more important than following whatever the teacher says.</p><p>You’re a role model for other teachers to follow. One of the best things about you is that you created a personal connection with each of your students. You had faith in all of us, and that made me work harder. You recognized us each as individuals, not just as a class. That made a difference. We love you like you love us.</p><p>Your smile is contagious and your enthusiasm is better than chocolate (which is saying something).</p><p>I’m not just writing this email because the class is over, or because my parents forced me to. I honestly think you are one of the best teachers ever. I’m incredibly grateful for the time and energy you put into our class. I really think you’re awesome!!!</p><p>Thank you for guiding us through this wonderful experience. I had so much fun learning with you.❤</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="shivali--3rd-grade-student">Shivali — 3rd Grade Student</h3><blockquote><p>I wrote a poem for you:</p><p><em>Ms. Ellen is so smart<br>She cares for us like family<br>Her voice makes us all happy to see her<br>We will always think she’s the best mathematician<br>She’s an artist some say but I say she’s everything</em></p></blockquote><hr><h2 id="💬-from-parents">💬 From Parents</h2><blockquote><p>“Thank you so so so so so much for being such a wonderful mentor and teacher to [our daughter]!
