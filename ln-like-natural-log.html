I started my middle school ‘Math Club’ and I went on to major in Math at UC Berkeley. At Cal, I served as president of the ‘Women in Mathematics (WiM)’ organization working to foster a supportive and inclusive community for aspiring mathematicians. I also taught and led sessions at the LA, Berkeley, and Stanford math circles, nurturing curiosity and introducing elementary through high school students to advanced mathematical concepts in engaging ways.</p><p>After graduating, I joined Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), the leader in advanced math education. My career at AoPS included five years running in-person Academies, launching several of the bay area locations, which meant hiring and mentoring a team, growing enrollments, and fostering a sense of belonging. I loved welcoming families into a supportive, warm culture that empowered and challenged students. Once the campus reached capacity, to broaden my reach, I took on the role of Director of the AoPS Virtual Campus, followed soon after by my role as Director of Engagement and Growth at AoPS, where I led cross-functional teams across marketing, engineering, product, and design, as well as traveled nationally to represent AoPS. Together, we expanded programs and resources to reach over a million learners worldwide, including training all of the United States’ International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team members.</p><p>In January 2025, I returned to the Campus Director role allows me to reconnect with what I love most: teaching students several times a week, mentoring educators, and supporting families in person. While I am passionate about helping millions of learners, teaching remains the heartbeat of my work—it keeps me deeply connected to our mission and the lives we are changing. Education is more than knowledge—it’s about inspiring curiosity, building confidence, and helping students tackle challenges with resilience and creativity.</p><p>I’m driven by a passion for equity and creative problem solving, creating opportunities that empower learners and teams alike. Let’s connect if you’re excited to inspire students, collaborate on bold ideas, or reimagine the future of education. Together, we can inspire the next generation of leaders.</p><hr><h2 id="my-personal-journey">My Personal Journey</h2><p>My top five personal values right now: <strong>peace, wisdom, authenticity, growth, and love</strong>.</p><p>Outside of career, in my time off, I’ve traveled to <strong>40+ countries</strong>, continuously learning, broadening my perspective, and sharing ideas across cultures and communities.</p><p>I believe deeply in <strong>presence</strong>: this moment will never come back again. I practice being in the present moment through <strong>journaling, meditation, and yoga</strong>. I also practice reiki, and love improv comedy. I truly believe ‘yes, and…’ is a way of life.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ellekul.github.io/dream-with-ellen/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ellekul.github.io/dream-with-ellen/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
