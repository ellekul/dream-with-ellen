In middle school, I founded a math club at my school and launched one at a nearby under-resourced school to share the excitement of problem-solving.</p><p>I went on to major in <strong>Mathematics at UC Berkeley</strong> as a Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholar, where I served as <strong>President of Women in Mathematics</strong> and worked closely with the Berkeley and Stanford math circles. During those years, I designed curriculum and presented advanced topics, such as combinatorics and linear algebra, in engaging ways to students from elementary through high school.</p><p>After graduation, I joined the company that sparked my passion for math, <strong>Art of Problem Solving (AoPS)</strong>, where I:</p><ul><li><strong>Opened AoPS’s first three Bay Area campuses</strong></li><li>Led the <strong>Virtual Campus</strong>, achieving <strong>30% growth in just 6 months</strong></li><li>Served as <strong>Director of Engagement and Growth</strong>, focusing on <strong>marketing, website design, CRO testing, and communications</strong></li></ul><p>Although I loved strategic work, I missed being close to students. In 2025, I returned to the classroom as <strong>Campus Director at AoPS Academy Irvine</strong>, where I now am able to work directly with students in the classroom again, while continuing to utilize business strategy to grow our center (in the last 6 months, we have grown 38%).</p><hr><h2 id="my-personal-journey">My Personal Journey</h2><p>My top five personal values right now: <strong>peace, wisdom, authenticity, growth, and love</strong>.</p><p>Outside of career, in my time off, I’ve traveled to <strong>40+ countries</strong>, continuously learning, broadening my perspective, and sharing ideas across cultures and communities.</p><p>I believe deeply in <strong>presence</strong>: this moment will never come back again. I practice being in the present moment through <strong>journaling, meditation, yoga, reiki, and improv comedy</strong>.</p><p>I only am who I am due to the incredible human beings in my closest orbit. They inspire me, mirror back my best self, and act as, what my friend Jazz calls, “mutual blindspot checkers.” They remind me to move toward “what feels warm” (shoutout Sus). I feel endlessly blessed to learn from, grow with, and be inspired by the people who make me who I am today.</p><p><em>(Special thanks to Josh for helping me make this site.)</em></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://ellekul.github.io/dream-with-ellen/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://ellekul.github.io/dream-with-ellen/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
